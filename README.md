Setup Wizard

This project was started after frustrations and difficultly finding 
an easy-to-use/modify template for a front-end GUI that can run on
virtually ever platform. 

This project is written in python3 and requires the kivy 
framework. The kivy framework is available for Linux (ARM and x86), 
Windows, macOS and Android.

This project has been tested on the following:
    - Ubuntu MATE (ARM, 16.04)
    - Ubuntu (x86, 16.04)
    - macOS (10.13.13)
    - Windows (10)

It has NOT been tested on Android


It will include a number classes (inherited Screens) that are useful
for general setup wizard screens, transitions between these screens
and a general/familiar visual setup for a setup wizard.
